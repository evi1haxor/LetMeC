# LetMeC
My projects in language C
-----------------

## codeblocks
codeblocks directory contains _just code_. I'm not onto any project in C at the moment, so most of the time I end up writing _just code_ type codeblocks.
### cp
This subdirectory contains some selective good problems given by our Computer Programming Professor under CS111 course at IIT Jodhpur.
